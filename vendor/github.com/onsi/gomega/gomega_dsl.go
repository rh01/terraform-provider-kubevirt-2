If you're using Ginkgo then you probably forgot to put your assertion in an It().
Alternatively, you may have forgotten to register a fail handler with RegisterFailHandler() or RegisterTestingT().
Depending on your vendoring solution you may be inadvertently importing gomega and subpackages (e.g. ghhtp, gexec,...) from different locations.

/*
Eventually enables making assertions on asynchronous behavior.

Eventually checks that an assertion *eventually* passes.  Eventually blocks when called and attempts an assertion periodically until it passes or a timeout occurs.  Both the timeout and polling interval are configurable as optional arguments.
The first optional argument is the timeout (which defaults to 1s), the second is the polling interval (which defaults to 10ms).  Both intervals can be specified as time.Duration, parsable duration strings or floats/integers (in which case they are interpreted as seconds).  In addition an optional context.Context can be passed in - Eventually will keep trying until either the timeout epxires or the context is cancelled, whichever comes first.

Eventually works with any Gomega compatible matcher and supports making assertions against three categories of actual value:

**Category 1: Making Eventually assertions on values**

There are several examples of values that can change over time.  These can be passed in to Eventually and will be passed to the matcher repeatedly until a match occurs.  For example:

	c := make(chan bool)
	go DoStuff(c)
	Eventually(c, "50ms").Should(BeClosed())

will poll the channel repeatedly until it is closed.  In this example `Eventually` will block until either the specified timeout of 50ms has elapsed or the channel is closed, whichever comes first.

Several Gomega libraries allow you to use Eventually in this way.  For example, the gomega/gexec package allows you to block until a *gexec.Session exits successfully via:

	Eventually(session).Should(gexec.Exit(0))

And the gomega/gbytes package allows you to monitor a streaming *gbytes.Buffer until a given string is seen:

	Eventually(buffer).Should(gbytes.Say("hello there"))

In these examples, both `session` and `buffer` are designed to be thread-safe when polled by the `Exit` and `Say` matchers.  This is not true in general of most raw values, so while it is tempting to do something like:

	// THIS IS NOT THREAD-SAFE
	var s *string
	go mutateStringEventually(s)
	Eventually(s).Should(Equal("I've changed"))

this will trigger Go's race detector as the goroutine polling via Eventually will race over the value of s with the goroutine mutating the string.  For cases like this you can use channels or introduce your own locking around s by passing Eventually a function.

**Category 2: Make Eventually assertions on functions**

Eventually can be passed functions that **return at least one value**.  When configured this way, Eventually will poll the function repeatedly and pass the first returned value to the matcher.

For example:

	   Eventually(func() int {
	   	return client.FetchCount()
	   }).Should(BeNumerically(">=", 17))

	will repeatedly poll client.FetchCount until the BeNumerically matcher is satisfied.  (Note that this example could have been written as Eventually(client.FetchCount).Should(BeNumerically(">=", 17)))

If multiple values are returned by the function, Eventually will pass the first value to the matcher and require that all others are zero-valued.  This allows you to pass Eventually a function that returns a value and an error - a common pattern in Go.

For example, consider a method that returns a value and an error:

	func FetchFromDB() (string, error)

Then

	Eventually(FetchFromDB).Should(Equal("got it"))

will pass only if and when the returned error is nil *and* the returned string satisfies the matcher.

Eventually can also accept functions that take arguments, however you must provide those arguments using .WithArguments().  For example, consider a function that takes a user-id and makes a network request to fetch a full name:

	func FetchFullName(userId int) (string, error)

You can poll this function like so:

	Eventually(FetchFullName).WithArguments(1138).Should(Equal("Wookie"))

It is important to note that the function passed into Eventually is invoked *synchronously* when polled.  Eventually does not (in fact, it cannot) kill the function if it takes longer to return than Eventually's configured timeout.  A common practice here is to use a context.  Here's an example that combines Ginkgo's spec timeout support with Eventually:

	It("fetches the correct count", func(ctx SpecContext) {
		Eventually(ctx, func() int {
			return client.FetchCount(ctx, "/users")
		}).Should(BeNumerically(">=", 17))
	}, SpecTimeout(time.Second))

you an also use Eventually().WithContext(ctx) to pass in the context.  Passed-in contexts play nicely with paseed-in arguments as long as the context appears first.  You can rewrite the above example as:

	It("fetches the correct count", func(ctx SpecContext) {
		Eventually(client.FetchCount).WithContext(ctx).WithArguments("/users").Should(BeNumerically(">=", 17))
	}, SpecTimeout(time.Second))

Either way the context passd to Eventually is also passed to the underlying funciton.  Now, when Ginkgo cancels the context both the FetchCount client and Gomega will be informed and can exit.

**Category 3: Making assertions _in_ the function passed into Eventually**

When testing complex systems it can be valuable to assert that a _set_ of assertions passes Eventually.  Eventually supports this by accepting functions that take a single Gomega argument and return zero or more values.

Here's an example that makes some assertions and returns a value and error:

	Eventually(func(g Gomega) (Widget, error) {
		ids, err := client.FetchIDs()
		g.Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
		g.Expect(ids).To(ContainElement(1138))
		return client.FetchWidget(1138)
	}).Should(Equal(expectedWidget))

will pass only if all the assertions in the polled function pass and the return value satisfied the matcher.

Eventually also supports a special case polling function that takes a single Gomega argument and returns no values.  Eventually assumes such a function is making assertions and is designed to work with the Succeed matcher to validate that all assertions have passed.
For example:

	Eventually(func(g Gomega) {
		model, err := client.Find(1138)
		g.Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
		g.Expect(model.Reticulate()).To(Succeed())
		g.Expect(model.IsReticulated()).To(BeTrue())
		g.Expect(model.Save()).To(Succeed())
	}).Should(Succeed())

will rerun the function until all assertions pass.

You can also pass additional arugments to functions that take a Gomega.  The only rule is that the Gomega argument must be first.  If you also want to pass the context attached to Eventually you must ensure that is the second argument.  For example:

	Eventually(func(g Gomega, ctx context.Context, path string, expected ...string){
		tok, err := client.GetToken(ctx)
		g.Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())

		elements, err := client.Fetch(ctx, tok, path)
		g.Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
		g.Expect(elements).To(ConsistOf(expected))
	}).WithContext(ctx).WithArguments("/names", "Joe", "Jane", "Sam").Should(Succeed())

Finally, in addition to passing timeouts and a context to Eventually you can be more explicit with Eventually's chaining configuration methods:

	Eventually(..., "1s", "2s", ctx).Should(...)

is equivalent to

	Eventually(...).WithTimeout(time.Second).WithPolling(2*time.Second).WithContext(ctx).Should(...)

Consistently, like Eventually, enables making assertions on asynchronous behavior.

Consistently blocks when called for a specified duration.  During that duration Consistently repeatedly polls its matcher and ensures that it is satisfied.  If the matcher is consistently satisfied, then Consistently will pass.  Otherwise Consistently will fail.

Both the total waiting duration and the polling interval are configurable as optional arguments.  The first optional argument is the duration that Consistently will run for (defaults to 100ms), and the second argument is the polling interval (defaults to 10ms).  As with Eventually, these intervals can be passed in as time.Duration, parsable duration strings or an integer or float number of seconds.  You can also pass in an optional context.Context - Consistently will exit early (with a failure) if the context is cancelled before the waiting duration expires.

Consistently accepts the same three categories of actual as Eventually, check the Eventually docs to learn more.

Consistently is useful in cases where you want to assert that something *does not happen* for a period of time.  For example, you may want to assert that a goroutine does *not* send data down a channel.  In this case you could write:

	Consistently(channel, "200ms").ShouldNot(Receive())

This will block for 200 milliseconds and repeatedly check the channel and ensure nothing has been received.

/*
StopTrying can be used to signal to Eventually and Consistentlythat they should abort and stop trying.  This always results in a failure of the assertion - and the failure message is the content of the StopTrying signal.

You can send the StopTrying signal by either returning StopTrying("message") as an error from your passed-in function _or_ by calling StopTrying("message").Now() to trigger a panic and end execution.

You can also wrap StopTrying around an error with `StopTrying("message").Wrap(err)` and can attach additional objects via `StopTrying("message").Attach("description", object).  When rendered, the signal will include the wrapped error and any attached objects rendered using Gomega's default formatting.

Here are a couple of examples.  This is how you might use StopTrying() as an error to signal that Eventually should stop:

	playerIndex, numPlayers := 0, 11
	Eventually(func() (string, error) {
	    if playerIndex == numPlayers {
	        return "", StopTrying("no more players left")
	    }
	    name := client.FetchPlayer(playerIndex)
	    playerIndex += 1
	    return name, nil
	}).Should(Equal("Patrick Mahomes"))

And here's an example where `StopTrying().Now()` is called to halt execution immediately:

	Eventually(func() []string {
		names, err := client.FetchAllPlayers()
		if err == client.IRRECOVERABLE_ERROR {
			StopTrying("Irrecoverable error occurred").Wrap(err).Now()

If a timeout occurs before the next poll is triggered both `Eventually` and `Consistently` will always fail with the content of the TryAgainAfter message.

// The assertion is tried periodically and is required to pass for a period of time.
//
// Both the total time and polling interval are configurable as optional arguments:
// The first optional argument is the duration that Consistently will run for
// The second optional argument is the polling interval
//
// Both intervals can either be specified as time.Duration, parsable duration strings or as floats/integers.  In the
// last case they are interpreted as seconds.
//
// If Consistently is passed an actual that is a function taking no arguments and returning at least one value,
// then Consistently will call the function periodically and try the matcher against the function's first return value.
//
// If the function returns more than one value, then Consistently will pass the first value to the matcher and
// assert that all other values are nil/zero.
// This allows you to pass Consistently a function that returns a value and an error - a common pattern in Go.
//
// Consistently is useful in cases where you want to assert that something *does not happen* over a period of time.
// For example, you want to assert that a goroutine does *not* send data down a channel.  In this case, you could:
//
//   Consistently(channel).ShouldNot(Receive())
